# An AI approach to nail disease identification

We've collected nail data-set throught web scrapping and manual collection from people.
We've imported the VGG16 weights and made a model to identify melanoma and yellow nails.
The notebook deepnail.ipynb is attached.

Finally the model is converted to tflite and integrated with an android application. The app source code is present with the tflite model.
