# Nail_Disease_detection_CNN
This project proposes an AI approach to detect and classify nail diseases from images. A distinct class of two diseases i.e. yellow nail syndrome and Subungual Melanoma is classified in this project. The framework uses an Artificial Neural Network based model for training and testing. We have used the concept of transfer learning for the training of model, because making a model from scratch is not possible with so less data and less GPU. The model is an implementation of VGG16[4] of Keras library with two layers of ANN. Due to the non-existence of a meticulous dataset, a new dataset was built for testing the enactment of our proposed framework. This work has been tested on our dataset and has been shown to have an excelled performance in the area identifying diseases.
